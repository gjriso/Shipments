# Shipments
Python project applied to detect anomalies in shipments
THe Python code contains all the steps build a machine learning process. The steps are as follow:
1. Data Exploration
2. Data Anaysis
3. Data Transformation
4. Modeling

It is important to understand that the code goes only until the point that I show that I:
1. Udnerstand the problem without any particular knowledge of the business processes or data.
2. That I know how to manipulate dataset, could be from the same data source or multiple data sources.
3. I apllied the principles of machine learning
4. In a separate slide that I understand how is the process of implementing or operationalize these rules


I was not trying to get a model that was able to identify all the potential anomalies. That journey takes more time.
